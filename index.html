                        </h2>
                        <p>I am Ketsia Dusenge. Originally from Rwanda. I am currently a computer science major at Hendrix college. I am a Tech enthusiast eager to explore and learn different fields in Technology. I have worked on different projects within the last 2 years. One of the Projects I worked on is a Model that detected one's sex at birth using their fingerprints. This  project gave me an oportunity to dive into the Machine learning field of Computer science. I have also worked on different mobile applications as a quality assusance tester and Graphical User Interface designer. Currently, I am taking my Database and Websystems class, I will be updating my potfolio regularly as I work on many more exciting projects.</p>
